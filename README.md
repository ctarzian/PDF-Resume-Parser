# Building a Resume Parser: Turning Unstructured Data into a Dataset

The code was built to turn unstructured data into a structured dataset. It works to parse through a candidate's resume and returns their Full Name, Cell Phone, Email, College, Education Level, Company's worked for, Job Title and Skillset. 

I utilized various NLP techniques throughout including n-grams, punctuation removal, tokenization, text-cleaning, and the removing of stop-words. I also implemented web scraping using Selenium and Beautiful Soup to get access to valuable information such as Company names and Colleges, so as to build an archive to help identify information in the resumes. 

I was inspired to do this project as my work as a recruiter requires me to sift through resumes all the time and identify high-priority candidates. This was my first foray into turning unstructured data into a dataset and I welcome any feedback or insight to improve the code. Cheers!
